# About Me
Hello! My name is Nicolette and I am a 2nd year Master of Public Health candidate at Columbia University. This website was created as part of an assignment for a Data Science class I am taking but who knows? I might continue to update it as I continue on this uphill journey of learning R. As it was once said, "One must imagine Sisyphys happy" ~
